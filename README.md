# Mini Quiz Academy

This is a starter static quiz site built for GitHub Pages.

## How it works
- Students enter their name
- A 10-question quiz starts with a 5-minute timer
- Results show at the end

## Update questions
Edit `questions.json` to update the quiz content. Each question has:
- `question`: the question text
- `choices`: array of answer options
- `answer`: the index of the correct choice (0-based)

## Run locally
Open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve the folder with any local web server.

## Deploy
Enable GitHub Pages from the repository settings and select the `main` branch root.
